# Sources — `task-models` skill (schema-therapy #8)

Grounded source-of-truth library for hierarchical task modelling (ConcurTaskTrees / CTT)
and the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM). This skill turns behavior specs (06 gherkin) and
personas (07) into `specs/08-task-models/<persona>-<job>.xml` — one CTT task model per
persona-job, with CTT temporal operators and a per-job KLM efficiency budget.

### KLM operator table (verbatim from the Kieras course text — the harness's KLM arithmetic basis)

| Operator | Meaning | Time (sec) |
|---|---|---|
| **K** | Keystroke / button press | 0.28 (recommended for typical user; range .12 expert–1.2 worst) |
| **T(n)** | Type a chunk of n chars | n × K |
| **P** | Point with mouse to target | 1.1 (Fitts'-law range .8–1.5) |
| **B** | Press *or* release mouse button | 0.1 |
| **BB** | Click (press+release) | 0.2 |
| **H** | Home hands between keyboard/mouse | 0.4 |
| **M** | Mental act (routine thinking/perception) | 1.2 (range .6–1.35) |
| **W(t)** | Wait for system response | t (must be measured; "R" in Card/Moran/Newell) |

KLM total = simple sum of operator times along the expert, error-free action sequence.
Determinism rule for the budget: per-job KLM budget is a deterministic sum; the only
judgement variable is M-count/placement — the skill must fix an M-placement convention
(Kieras' heuristics: initiate-task M, retrieve-chunk M, locate-on-screen M, verify-step M)
so the budget is reproducible.

### CTT temporal operators (consolidated from the W3C Note + Paternò chapter)

N-ary (parent → 2+ children), with XML element names from the W3C Note Schema:
- **Enabling** `>>` `<Enabling>` — T2 cannot start until T1 completes. Variant **Enabling-with-information-passing** `[]>>` (`SequentialEnablingInfo`): completed task hands data to the next.
- **Choice** `[]` `<Choice>` — pick one task from the set; once one starts, the others are disabled.
- **Interleaving** `|||` `<Interleaving>` — concurrent, no constraint.
- **Synchronisation** `|[]|` `<Synchronization>` — concurrent *and* exchange information.
- **Parallelism** `<Parallelism>` — true parallel execution.
- **Order Independence** `|=|` `<OrderIndependence>` — any order, but one finishes before the next starts.
- **Disabling** `[>` `<Disabling>` — the left task is deactivated once the right task starts.
- **Suspend-Resume** `|>` `<SuspendResume>` — right task interrupts left; left resumes from its prior state afterward.

Unary (parent → 1 child):
- **Iteration** `T*` `<Iterative>` — repeats from the beginning on termination; `T{n}` for finite count.
- **Optional** `[T]` `<Optional>` — the task may be skipped.

Task categories (W3C Note): **User**, **System**, **Interaction**, **Abstract**.
Precedence (Paternò/CTT, tightest → loosest): unary (iteration/optional) bind tightest,
then enabling/disabling, then choice, then the concurrent family (interleaving / sync /
parallelism / order-independence). The skill's walker must encode this precedence to
parse flat operator sequences; the W3C XML Schema sidesteps precedence by making the tree
explicit (operators nest as elements), so a Schema-conformant XML file is unambiguous.

Maps onto the gherkin scenario tags the skill consumes:
`@transition` → Enabling / SequentialEnablingInfo; `@policy`/`@invariant` → Precondition /
PostCondition `ConditionGroup`; `@terminal` → leaf Interaction/System task or Disabling target.

## Probe — empirical search for a runnable, scriptable CTT engine

**Verdict: NO maintained, scriptable CTT simulation engine exists. Recommendation: vendor a
Rec-faithful CTT walker over the W3C Note's operator semantics + deterministic KLM arithmetic.**

Environment: Node v24.13.0, npm 11.6.2, Python 3.9.6, Java present (jenv shims). Workspace: `/tmp/ctt-probe`.

What was searched and found:

1. **npm** — `npm search` for `concurtasktrees`, `ctt task model`, `task-model ctt`,
   `hierarchical task analysis`, `ctt simulator`; plus the registry full-text API
   (`registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=concurtasktrees` → **total 0**; `…text=ctt+task+model+temporal`
   → 0 relevant; matches were the unrelated *ctt-web-components* Portuguese design system and
   GFM markdown *task-list-item* utilities). **No CTT engine on npm.**
2. **PyPI** — JSON-API probes: `concurtasktrees` 404, `ctt-task-model` 404, `task-model-ctt` 404,
   `hamsters-task-model` 404. `pyctt` returned HTTP 200 → **investigated and rejected**: it is a
   Python client for **CTT.pt, the Portuguese postal service** (Correios de Portugal package
   tracking, v1.0.1, 2019) — nothing to do with ConcurTaskTrees. **No CTT engine on PyPI.**
3. **GitHub** — repo search: `concurtasktrees` → **0 results**; `ConcurTaskTrees simulator` → 0;
   `CTT temporal operator parser` → 0; `task model enabling operator` → 1 unrelated repo.
   **No CTT engine on GitHub.**
4. **CTTE (ConcurTaskTrees Environment, ISTI-CNR)** — the original Paternò-group tool. It *does*
   ship a "Task Model Simulator" that enables-only the currently-performable tasks — exactly the
   semantics we need — **but it is a desktop Java GUI** launched as `ctte` / `java DrawTree`. No
   documented headless/batch/CLI mode, no published API artifact, distributed as a legacy GUI
   bundle (Inria CADP also redistributes it as a GUI). Headless invocation is **not realistic**:
   the simulator is bound to the Swing/AWT UI. **Rejected as an automated oracle.**
5. **HAMSTERS / HAMSTERS-XL (IRIT ICS, Martinie & Palanque)** — a more expressive LOTOS-operator
   task tool that advertises "a task model simulator as a dedicated API for simulating execution
   of task sequences." Assessed and **not admitted**: it is a desktop Java CASE tool; the "API" is
   an internal Java library inside the GUI distribution, the download is request/academic-gated
   (`irit.fr/ICS/tools/`), there is no npm/pip/Maven-pinnable artifact and no headless CLI. Not
   reproducibly pinnable in a CI harness. **Cite-only.**

**Conclusion for the simulation contract (§0).** Both engines that exist (CTTE, HAMSTERS) are
unmaintained-for-scripting desktop Java GUIs; the package ecosystems are empty. The deterministic
oracle must therefore be a **vendored, Rec-faithful CTT walker** implementing the W3C Note's
operator semantics (the consolidated operator table above is the spec), which:
- parses the W3C-Schema XML task model into the operator tree,
- given a task-execution state, enumerates the **ENABLED set** (the tasks currently performable
  under the temporal operators — the same notion CTTE's simulator computes), and
- pairs with **deterministic KLM arithmetic** (the Kieras operator table above, with a fixed
  M-placement convention) to compute the per-job efficiency budget.
This is fully grounded in gatherable sources and needs no external engine.

## Authority alignment (precedence on contradiction)

1. **CTT operator semantics** → **Fabio Paternò is canonical.** Order of authority:
   Paternò's *Model-Based Design and Evaluation* (1999, cite-only) and the engineered-notation
   chapter (2004, gathered) define the operators and their formal/LOTOS-based semantics; the
   INTERACT '97 paper is the origin cite. Where the W3C Note and Paternò agree (they do — Paternò
   is a Note editor), either may be quoted.
2. **The XML interchange format / meta-model** → **the W3C Task Models Note (2014) is canonical.**
   Standing: it is a **Working Group Note**, *not* a Recommendation — the WG stopped advancing it
   on the Rec-track. A Note does **not** carry Rec-level normative weight and is not superseded the
   way a Rec is; but it remains **the only standardized, machine-readable CTT task-model format
   (UML meta-model + XML Schema)** and is co-authored by the canonical CTT authors (Paternò,
   Santoro, Spano + Raggett). Treat it as the authoritative *format* spec, with Paternò's writings
   authoritative for any *semantic* fine point the Schema leaves implicit (e.g., operator
   precedence, which the explicit XML tree renders moot in practice).
3. **KLM operators & arithmetic** → **Card, Moran & Newell are canonical** (1980 CACM paper for
   the model; *The Psychology of HCI*, 1983, cite-only, for the full treatment). The **Kieras
   course text (1993, gathered)** is the authoritative *open* operator table and the practical
   M-placement guidance the skill should codify; where Kieras renames/extends (W for Wait vs. the
   original R for Response, M-placement heuristics) he flags it explicitly and defers to
   Card/Moran/Newell — so no contradiction, Kieras is an admitted faithful extension.

### Contradictions found + ruling
- **Engineered-notation chapter date: 2003 vs 2004.** The ISTI-CNR publication id is `2003-A1-07`
  and the filename carries "2003", but the host book — *The Handbook of Task Analysis for HCI*
  (Diaper & Stanton, eds., ISBN 0805844325) — is a **2004** publication (PDF metadata Title/ISBN
  confirm the book). **Ruling: cite as 2004** (book year), note the 2003 ISTI internal id.
- **Operator naming drift across sources.** Card/Moran/Newell call the wait operator **R**
  (Response time); Kieras renames it **W** (Wait) and says so. CTT "Concurrency" appears as
  **Interleaving / Synchronisation / Parallelism** (three distinct W3C-Schema elements) rather than
  one operator. **Ruling: adopt the W3C Note element names as the canonical surface vocabulary**
  for the XML the skill emits, and **Kieras' W** for the KLM wait operator; record the originals as
  synonyms so the skill never silently invents a name.
